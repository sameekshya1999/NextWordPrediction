Cinderella: A Tale of Hope and Kindness
Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a kind and gentle girl named Cinderella. She lived with her wicked stepmother and two stepsisters. Cinderella’s stepmother didn’t like her because she was kind-hearted and beautiful, unlike her own daughters, who were selfish and mean.

Hard Life at Home
Cinderella's father had passed away, leaving her alone with her stepmother and stepsisters. They made her do all the household chores, from scrubbing the floors to washing clothes and cooking meals. Cinderella had no choice but to obey them. Despite her hard work, they treated her poorly, giving her only old clothes to wear and making her sleep near the cold fireplace in the kitchen. Her face was often covered in ashes, which is why they called her "Cinderella."

Even though her life was difficult, Cinderella remained kind and hopeful. She would sing while she worked, and she found comfort in the little mice and birds that lived in the house. They became her friends, keeping her company during her lonely days.

The Royal Invitation
One day, an announcement was made throughout the kingdom. The King was hosting a grand ball at the palace, and every young lady was invited. The Prince would choose a bride from among the guests. Cinderella’s stepmother and stepsisters were excited. They immediately began preparing fancy dresses and dreaming of becoming the Prince's bride.

Cinderella also wished to go to the ball, but when she asked her stepmother, she just laughed and said, “You? Go to the ball? You don’t even have a decent dress to wear!” Her stepsisters teased her, saying she would only embarrass herself if she went. Her stepmother promised that Cinderella could attend if she finished all her chores and found something suitable to wear, but she had no intention of keeping that promise.

Cinderella’s Hopes and the Fairy Godmother
Cinderella worked hard all day, finishing every task her stepmother gave her. When she was done, she went up to the attic and found an old dress that belonged to her mother. With the help of her little animal friends, she fixed the dress, adding ribbons and beads they found around the house. Cinderella was hopeful as she put on the dress, thinking she might actually get to go to the ball.

But when her stepsisters saw her in the dress, they tore it to shreds, ripping off the ribbons and beads. They laughed and left for the ball with their mother, leaving Cinderella in tears. She ran into the garden, feeling heartbroken and wishing she could go to the ball. As she cried, a bright light appeared, and a kind, magical woman stood before her. It was Cinderella's Fairy Godmother.

A Magical Transformation
The Fairy Godmother smiled warmly at Cinderella and said, “You shall go to the ball, my dear.” With a wave of her wand, she transformed a pumpkin into a beautiful golden carriage. She turned mice into horses, a rat into a coachman, and lizards into footmen. Then, with another wave, she changed Cinderella’s torn dress into a stunning gown, sparkling with jewels. On her feet were glass slippers, the most beautiful shoes Cinderella had ever seen.

“Remember, my dear,” the Fairy Godmother warned, “the magic will only last until midnight. You must return before the clock strikes twelve.” Cinderella thanked her and climbed into the carriage, feeling like a princess.

The Grand Ball
When Cinderella arrived at the palace, everyone was captivated by her beauty, including the Prince. He couldn’t take his eyes off her and immediately asked her to dance. Cinderella danced with the Prince all evening, forgetting all about her stepmother, stepsisters, and the hardships she faced. They talked and laughed, and for the first time, Cinderella felt truly happy.

Her stepsisters, who didn’t recognize her in her magical dress, wondered who this mysterious, beautiful girl was. But Cinderella was too busy enjoying her magical evening to notice them.

The Stroke of Midnight
Just as the Prince was about to ask for her name, the clock began to chime midnight. Cinderella remembered the Fairy Godmother’s warning. She quickly thanked the Prince and ran out of the palace. In her hurry, she lost one of her glass slippers on the palace steps, but she didn’t stop to pick it up.

She reached her carriage just as it turned back into a pumpkin, and her gown changed back into rags. But Cinderella held on to the one glass slipper, a reminder of the magical night she had experienced.

The Prince’s Search
The next day, the Prince was determined to find the beautiful girl he had danced with. He had fallen in love with her and couldn’t imagine marrying anyone else. He took the glass slipper to every house in the kingdom, hoping to find the girl whose foot would fit the tiny slipper.

When he arrived at Cinderella’s house, her stepsisters tried to force their feet into the delicate shoe, but it was too small for both of them. Cinderella’s stepmother tried to keep her hidden, but the Prince insisted on seeing every girl in the house. Finally, Cinderella appeared, and when she tried on the slipper, it fit perfectly.

Happily Ever After
The Prince recognized her immediately as the girl from the ball. He asked her to marry him, and Cinderella gladly accepted. The Prince took her to the palace, where they were married in a grand ceremony. Her stepmother and stepsisters begged for her forgiveness, and Cinderella, being kind-hearted, forgave them.

Cinderella and the Prince lived happily ever after. She never forgot her difficult past but used it to become a wise and compassionate princess. She treated everyone in the kingdom with kindness and helped those in need, just as her Fairy Godmother had helped her.

The End.



Camels are curiously delicate animals, as anyone who has had
anything to do with them will know to his cost. They lose condition
very quickly and mysteriously, and do not regain it easily. Camel
travelling implies a perpetual fruitless attempt to maintain their
condition by seeking to reconcile progress and pasturing. The ideal
is to give the beasts at least four hours’ grazing, which must not
be at night or in the heat of the day, when the camel is prone to
rest in the shade of a tree instead of feeding. At the same time,
when it is very hot it is neither good for man nor beast to march;
nor should the camel march all night either, when four hours’ rest
are very desirable. Lastly, it must be remembered that it is tiring
for camels to be on and off loaded more than once a day, since every
time they kneel or get up with a heavy burden they are subjected to a
considerable strain; it is consequently inadvisable to divide a march
into two parts. To reach a satisfactory compromise is difficult. So
long as not more than about twenty miles a day are being covered,
any system works well enough, but where long marches are necessary
there is no really satisfactory solution. The Tuareg himself usually
starts late in the morning and marches till dusk, when he off-loads;
he then drives his camels to pasture, leaving them out all night;
they are slowly collected after dawn, when they have again begun to
feed. The disadvantage from the European point of view is that there
is always some delay in finding the camels in the morning, as one or
two are sure to have strayed, nor is it always safe to leave camels
wandering about unguarded at night. The French Camel Corps patrols
and other Europeans usually prefer to start in the night and march
until high noon or the early afternoon. I have myself tried every
course, and with all its disadvantages finally adopted the Tuareg
system. To these complications must be added the consideration that
if a camel is watered it should be at noon, when the sun is hot,
in order to make him drink well. If there is no reason to anticipate
long waterless journeys, camels are watered every third day, but if
they are required to cross difficult tracts of desert, the intervals
must gradually be increased beforehand. Above all, the camel must
be made really thirsty prior to his final drink before the longest
waterless portion of the journey is attempted. The camel must start
almost bursting with the water in his belly.

It is generally more important for a camel not to miss a day’s
pasture than a day’s water. When the rains have fallen and
green vegetation is abundant, camels need not be watered for long
intervals. If they are not being worked they can go for weeks without
drinking. Camels will eat anything if put to it, from hard grass with
a straw like wire to any kind of tree or shrub; acacia thorns three and
four inches long appear to make no difference to his digestion. Pasture
is the most important factor on the march, for the animal is really
a fastidious feeder and requires plenty of variety.

The woes which afflict the camel are numerous. First and worst are
saddle sores, which rapidly become stinking and gangrenous. They
develop quickly from a slight rub or gall under the saddle, and often
end by infecting the bones of the spine or ribs. They discharge a
thick offensive pus either through the sore or under the skin. In
treating them the first thing to do is to open the wound and let
the pus escape, after which the best cure, I found as others have
discovered, is to wash the wound with a strong solution of permanganate
of potash. Thereafter an iodoform dressing is almost miraculous in its
quick-healing properties, as it keeps away the flies, and consequently
obviates maggots and re-infection. The great black crows in Air have
an odious habit of sitting on the backs of camels and pecking at these
sores. They do terrible damage with their long powerful beaks. The
only way to keep them off is to tie a pair of crow’s wings to the
hair on the hump of the camel. The remedy is sovereign, as I learnt
by experience, but I am at a loss to explain the psychological process
governing the action of the live crows which are thus scared away.

Apart from deaths due to eating poisonous plants, which are far more
numerous in the Southland than in Air, the highest mortality among
camels in Air comes from a disease known locally as “blood in the
head.” It is a form of pernicious apoplexy or congestion of blood in
the head. The early symptoms are hard to observe unless one happens to
be born a Tuareg. As the attack develops the camel becomes dazed and
lies in the sun with rather a glassy stare, instead of feeding. Later
it runs about, hitting its head against trees, and finally falls to the
ground in contortions, dying very rapidly of a stroke. The disease is
especially common after the rains, when the pasture is rich or when
the animals are idle, recovering condition. If they are left in the
Southland for the whole year, the rich feeding there aggravates the
incidence of the disease. An attack may be staved off by the remedy,
which is also used for dealing with refractory animals, namely, of
putting tobacco snuff in their eyes. This apparently cruel treatment is
singularly efficacious, and I can only suppose that the irritation or
smarting has the effect of a stimulant which draws or dispels the blood
pressure. When the disease is more advanced, resort has to be had to
blood-letting; the jugular artery is cut a span below the left ear and
blood is drawn to an amount which will fill three cup-shaped hollows
in the ground made by removing a double handful of sand or earth
from each. The blood is seen at first to flow very dark in colour;
as it gradually resumes its normal hue, the hæmorrhage is stopped
by taking a tuft of hair, dipping it into the coagulated blood and
inserting it in the cut. As soon as a clot is formed the incision
is covered with sand. The whole proceeding sounds a fantastically
imprudent and septic way of dealing with an arterial hæmorrhage,
but it works most successfully. If camels are sickening for disease,
and especially for “blood in the head,” which may sometimes be
recognised by the premonitory symptom of very hard, dry droppings,
they are dosed with a mixture made of tobacco leaf, onion, and the
seed of grain called “Araruf,” containing a pungent oil apparently
of the mustard variety. These ingredients are pounded up, mixed with
about a gallon of water and poured down the camel’s throat.

Firing is resorted to for various ills, especially around bad sores
to prevent them from spreading and to induce healing. A cow is very
often fired across the flanks after calving, when she is also given
a goatskin-full of millet and water “to fill up the empty space
in her belly.” Firing round the breast pad is carried out when
the animal is suffering from the disease which causes the pad to
split. Mange is fairly frequent, and is treated with a mixture of oil
and ashes. The worst disease of all is called “Tara,” for which
there is said to be no cure: the symptoms are a wasting of the legs,
and eventual death from debility and breakage of the bones: luckily
I had no experience of the malady, which is said to be infectious or
contagious. The Tuareg say that there is no reason for its coming,
but that Allah sometimes unaccountably sends it.

The Tuareg empiric remedies, other than those described, are not
interesting except in their treatment of gangrenous wounds. When they
have washed the wound with a lotion of female camel urine or brewed
from one of several plants which seem to have remarkably little effect,
they cover the exposed flesh with a powder of crumbled donkey droppings
dried in the sun. I was appalled at the danger of septic infection
when I first saw the practice, but soon discovered that the powder,
which had, I supposed, become sterilised in the sun, was a really
effectual method of preventing the great harm caused by flies settling
on the wound. I can now confidently recommend this practice.

Camels, of course, are branded with tribal marks, a complete study
of which would be worth making. Each mark has its own name, and many
of them are derived from certain known symbols or perhaps letters,
all of which call for investigation in connection with marks from
other parts of Africa. Some of the principal brands in Air are given
in Plate 21, the most interesting being the mark of the Ghati Tuareg
(Azger); it is called the Hatita, after the name of the famous leader
of Barth’s day.

This necessarily brief note on the animal which is so intimately
bound up with the life of the People of the Veil, not to say their
very existence, may be supplemented by some mention of the other
domestic animals of Air.

In Nigeria the best horses are described as Asben horses; yet in Air
there is hardly a horse to be seen. The explanation is presumably
that the Tuareg bring, or used to bring, the best horses for sale in
Hausaland; but they were not necessarily bred in Air. The supposition
is reasonable, for the Tuareg north of Sokoto, and especially the
Aulimmiden, west of Air, possess a number of horses which are renowned
for their hardiness, and of course all Tuareg in the Southland are
called Asbenawa. In Air the best of the few horses are, with an
even lesser show of logic, described as Bagezan horses; but there
are no horses in the mountains. The tracks are far too rough for
there ever at any time to have been a considerable number of horses
in the hills. I can offer no explanation of the name. Air is not a
horse-breeding country. The pasture is too rough even after the rains,
while during the dry season the only green stuff is on the trees,
which, even if it were good fodder for horses, could only be reached
by animals of the build of camels. The few horses which I saw in Air
belonged to the Sultan at Agades and to the Añastafidet. They were
small and wiry but rather nondescript, a variable cross of Arab and
Sudanese blood; in no case could they be said to represent an “Air
breed.” The Tuareg say the horse came to Air from the north, and
in point of fact all those I saw bore a certain resemblance to the
little animals of Tripolitania. There are probably not more than 100
horses in Air altogether to-day. Water is far too scarce a commodity
for horses to be much used for travelling. Those in the mountains
are never watered more than once a day, and can easily do three days
between drinking without undue fatigue.

The other domestic animals are donkeys, cattle, sheep, goats, dogs and
a few Hausa cats. Falconry is not a pastime in Air. The cattle come
from the south; they are of the humped and ordinary varieties. The
bulls are used for drawing water from the garden irrigation wells;
cows are more scarce. Before the war the Tuareg used to carry on an
active trade in cattle, buying from the Fulani in Damergu and selling
to the people of Ghat and the Fezzan. Incredible as it may seem,
cattle used to be driven over the roads to Ghat after the rains, and
do as much as four and five days without water. The mortality must have
been considerable, but their cheapness in the Southland made the trade
profitable. It is curious how all the animals in Air, including man,
seem to get used to going without water for long periods. Oxen are
used to a certain extent as pack animals both in Air and Damergu;
Barth started his journey from Northern Air to Agades on an ox;
he considered this mount indifferent as a means of transport, for
he fell off and nearly broke his compass. The association of cattle
with a well-watered country where they can drink every day must be
dismissed in the Sahara, and this disposes of one of the difficulties
surrounding the problem of the ox-drawn chariots of the Garamantes
which so exercised Duveyrier;[181] loaded oxen can march comfortably
with water only every third day.

The donkey is very nearly as good a performer in the desert as the
camel. In austerity of diet he is better, being less fastidious
about pasture and quite as capable of doing four and five days in
cold weather, between wells. But his pace is even slower than that of
the camel, and his maximum load should not exceed 100 lbs. Curiously
enough, donkeys suffer from the same disease as camels after the rains:
they get “blood in the head,” but in their case a treatment of
snuff in the eyes is said to be useless. They have to be bled by
making an incision with a curious bent iron instrument in the roof
of the mouth above the lower molars. The operation looks ridiculous,
but the donkey is always a humorous beast. The ones in Air and nearly
all those in the Southland are small grey animals, standing not more
than four feet from the ground, with straight knife-edged backs. I
saw none of the large white donkeys of Egypt. Near T’imia and in
the north-eastern parts of Air there are a number of wild donkeys,
roaming unbroken and unherded. They are the descendants of domestic
donkeys driven out to propagate and find their own livelihood by
certain tribes who claim them when captured in their own areas. These
animals, like the gazelle of the country, exist on pasture alone, for
they often encounter no open water to drink for ten months of the year.

The commonest domestic animals are the sheep and goats. Every village
and tribe has large herds. After the camels they constitute the
principal wealth of the people and do exceedingly well. The sheep
are all of the gaunt wire-haired variety without woollen fleeces,
resembling goats. The latter provide most of the milk in the villages,
and vary in colour from white to black, with every intermediate shade
of brown and type of marking. Curiously enough, none of the Tuareg
of Air, and, I believe, none of the other groups, either spin the
hair of goats or the wool of their own camels. A good sheep in 1922
could be bought for six to seven and a goat for four to five silver
francs. Camels ranged between £5 and £12 a head.
